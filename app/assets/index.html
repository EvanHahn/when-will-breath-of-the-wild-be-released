  <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the next Zelda title to be released. Many fans are very excited. We'd count the days if we could, but we don't know exactly when it comes out.</p>

  <p>Can we <em>guess</em> when Breath of the Wild will come out?</p>

    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/">Nintendo has tweeted</a> and repeatedly mentioned a {{ releaseYear }} release date. What does that mean?</p>

    <div class="release-year-box">
      <span class="release-year-box-header">Release year:</span>
      <span class="release-year-box-year display-1">{{ releaseYear }}</span>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>December 31, {{ releaseYear }}</strong> is {{ releaseYearToLatest }}. That's the <strong>longest</strong> we'll have to wait.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>January 1, {{ releaseYear }}</strong> is {{ releaseYearToEarliest }}. That's the <strong>shortest</strong> we have to wait.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>July 2, {{ releaseYear }}</strong> is {{ releaseYearToMiddle }}. That's the <strong>middle</strong> of the year.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>So that's one way to look at it: looking at different parts of {{ releaseYear }}.</p>

    <p>What if we looked at something else?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>There have been <strong>{{ games.length }} Zelda games</strong> across {{ releases.length }} releases, of which <strong>{{ mainSeriesGames.length }} are in the main series</strong>.</p>
