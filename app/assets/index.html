  <p>Can we <em>guess</em> when Breath of the Wild will come out?</p>

    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/">Nintendo has tweeted</a> and repeatedly mentioned a {{ releaseYear }} release date. What does that mean?</p>

    <div class="release-year-box">
      <span class="release-year-box-header">Release year:</span>
      <span class="release-year-box-year display-1">{{ releaseYear }}</span>
    </div>

    <p><strong>January 1, {{ releaseYear }}</strong> is {{ releaseYearToEarliest }}</p>

    <p><strong>December 31, {{ releaseYear }}</strong> is {{ releaseYearToLatest }}</p>

    <p><strong>July 2, {{ releaseYear }}</strong> (the exact middle of the year) is {{ releaseYearToMiddle}}</p>
